<p>“You look worried, dear,” said Eleanor.
</p><p>“I am worried,” admitted Suzanne; “not worried exactly, but anxious.&nbsp; You see, my birthday happens next week – ”
</p><p>“You lucky person,” interrupted Eleanor; “my birthday doesn’t come till the end of March.”
</p><p>“Well, old Bertram Kneyght is over in England just now from the Argentine.&nbsp; He’s a kind of distant cousin of my mother’s, and so enormously rich that we’ve never let the relationship drop out of sight.&nbsp; Even if we don’t see him or hear from him for years he is always Cousin Bertram when he does turn up.&nbsp; I can’t say he’s ever been of much solid use to us, but yesterday the subject of my birthday cropped up, and he asked me to let him know what I wanted for a present.”
</p><p>“Now I understand the anxiety,” observed Eleanor.
</p><p>“As a rule when one is confronted with a problem like that,” said Suzanne, “all one’s ideas vanish; one doesn’t seem to have a desire in the world.&nbsp; Now it so happens that I have been very keen on a little Dresden figure that I saw somewhere in Kensington; about thirty-six shillings, quite beyond my means.&nbsp; I was very nearly describing the figure, and giving Bertram the address of the shop.&nbsp; And then it suddenly struck me that thirty-six shillings was such a ridiculously inadequate sum for a man of his immense wealth to spend on a birthday present.&nbsp; He could give thirty-six pounds as easily as you or I could buy a bunch of violets.&nbsp; I don’t want to be greedy, of course, but I don’t like being wasteful.”
</p><p>“The question is,” said Eleanor, “what are his ideas as to present-giving?&nbsp; Some of the wealthiest people have curiously cramped views on that subject.&nbsp; When people grow gradually rich their requirements and standard of living expand in proportion, while their present-giving instincts often remain in the undeveloped condition of their earlier days.&nbsp; Something showy and not-too-expensive in a shop is their only conception of the ideal gift.&nbsp; That is why even quite good shops have their counters and windows crowded with things worth about four shillings that look as if they might be worth seven-and-six, and are priced at ten shillings and labelled seasonable gifts.’”
</p><p>“I know,” said Suzanne; “that is why it is so risky to be vague when one is giving indications of one’s wants.&nbsp; Now if I say to him: ‘I am going out to Davos this winter, so anything in the travelling line would be acceptable,’ he might give me a dressing-bag with gold-mounted fittings, but, on the other hand, he might give me Baedeker’s Switzerland, or ‘Skiing without Tears,’ or something of that sort.”
</p><p>“He would be more likely to say: ‘She’ll be going to lots of dances, a fan will be sure to be useful.’”
</p><p>“Yes, and I’ve got tons of fans, so you see where the danger and anxiety lies.&nbsp; Now if there is one thing more than another that I really urgently want it is furs.&nbsp; I simply haven’t any.&nbsp; I’m told that Davos is full of Russians, and they are sure to wear the most lovely sables and things.&nbsp; To be among people who are smothered in furs when one hasn’t any oneself makes one want to break most of the Commandments.”
</p><p>“If it’s furs that you’re out for,” said Eleanor, “you will have to superintend the choice of them in person.&nbsp; You can’t be sure that your cousin knows the difference between silver-fox and ordinary squirrel.”
</p><p>“There are some heavenly silver-fox stoles at Goliath and Mastodon’s,” said Suzanne, with a sigh; “if I could only inveigle Bertram into their building and take him for a stroll through the fur department!”
</p><p>“He lives somewhere near there, doesn’t he?” said Eleanor.&nbsp; “Do you know what his habits are?&nbsp; Does he take a walk at any particular time of day?”
</p><p>“He usually walks down to his club about three o’clock, if it’s a fine day.&nbsp; That takes him right past Goliath and Mastodon’s.”
</p><p>“Let us two meet him accidentally at the street corner to-morrow,” said Eleanor; “we can walk a little way with him, and with luck we ought to be able to side-track him into the shop.&nbsp; You can say you want to get a hair-net or something.&nbsp; When we’re safely there I can say: ‘I wish you’d tell me what you want for your birthday.’&nbsp; Then you’ll have everything ready to hand – the rich cousin, the fur department, and the topic of birthday presents.”
</p><p>“It’s a great idea,” said Suzanne; “you really are a brick.&nbsp; Come round to-morrow at twenty to three; don’t be late, we must carry out our ambush to the minute.”
</p><p>At a few minutes to three the next afternoon the fur-trappers walked warily towards the selected corner.&nbsp; In the near distance rose the colossal pile of Messrs.&nbsp; Goliath and Mastodon’s famed establishment.&nbsp; The afternoon was brilliantly fine, exactly the sort of weather to tempt a gentleman of advancing years into the discreet exercise of a leisurely walk.
</p><p>“I say, dear, I wish you’d do something for me this evening,” said Eleanor to her companion; “just drop in after dinner on some pretext or other, and stay on to make a fourth at bridge with Adela and the aunts.&nbsp; Otherwise I shall have to play, and Harry Scarisbrooke is going to come in unexpectedly about nine-fifteen, and I particularly want to be free to talk to him while the others are playing.”
</p><p>“Sorry, my dear, no can do,” said Suzanne; “ordinary bridge at three-pence a hundred, with such dreadfully slow players as your aunts, bores me to tears.&nbsp; I nearly go to sleep over it.”
</p><p>“But I most particularly want an opportunity to talk with Harry,” urged Eleanor, an angry glint coming into her eyes.
</p><p>“Sorry, anything to oblige, but not that,” said Suzanne cheerfully; the sacrifices of friendship were beautiful in her eyes as long as she was not asked to make them.
</p><p>Eleanor said nothing further on the subject, but the corners of her mouth rearranged themselves.
</p><p>“There’s our man!” exclaimed Suzanne suddenly; “hurry!”
</p><p>Mr. Bertram Kneyght greeted his cousin and her friend with genuine heartiness, and readily accepted their invitation to explore the crowded mart that stood temptingly at their elbow.&nbsp; The plate-glass doors swung open and the trio plunged bravely into the jostling throng of buyers and loiterers.
</p><p>“Is it always as full as this?” asked Bertram of Eleanor.
</p><p>“More or less, and autumn sales are on just now,” she replied.
</p><p>Suzanne, in her anxiety to pilot her cousin to the desired haven of the fur department, was usually a few paces ahead of the others, coming back to them now and then if they lingered for a moment at some attractive counter, with the nervous solicitude of a parent rook encouraging its young ones on their first flying expedition.
</p><p>“It’s Suzanne’s birthday on Wednesday next,” confided Eleanor to Bertram Kneyght at a moment when Suzanne had left them unusually far behind; “my birthday comes the day before, so we are both on the look-out for something to give each other.”
</p><p>“Ah,” said Bertram.&nbsp; “Now, perhaps you can advise me on that very point.&nbsp; I want to give Suzanne something, and I haven’t the least idea what she wants.”
</p><p>“She’s rather a problem,” said Eleanor.&nbsp; “She seems to have everything one can think of, lucky girl.&nbsp; A fan is always useful; she’ll be going to a lot of dances at Davos this winter.&nbsp; Yes, I should think a fan would please her more than anything.&nbsp; After our birthdays are over we inspect each other’s muster of presents, and I always feel dreadfully humble.&nbsp; She gets such nice things, and I never have anything worth showing.&nbsp; You see, none of my relations or any of the people who give me presents are at all well off, so I can’t expect them to do anything more than just remember the day with some little trifle.&nbsp; Two years ago an uncle on my mother’s side of the family, who had come into a small legacy, promised me a silver-fox stole for my birthday.&nbsp; I can’t tell you how excited I was about it, how I pictured myself showing it off to all my friends and enemies.&nbsp; Then just at that moment his wife died, and, of course, poor man, he could not be expected to think of birthday presents at such a time.&nbsp; He has lived abroad ever since, and I never got my fur.&nbsp; Do you know, to this day I can scarcely look at a silver-fox pelt in a shop window or round anyone’s neck without feeling ready to burst into tears.&nbsp; I suppose if I hadn’t had the prospect of getting one I shouldn’t feel that way.&nbsp; Look, there is the fan counter, on your left; you can easily slip away in the crowd.&nbsp; Get her as nice a one as you can see – she is such a dear, dear girl.”
</p><p>“Hullo, I thought I had lost you,” said Suzanne, making her way through an obstructive knot of shoppers.&nbsp; “Where is Bertram?”
</p><p>“I got separated from him long ago.&nbsp; I thought he was on ahead with you,” said Eleanor.&nbsp; “We shall never find him in this crush.”
</p><p>Which turned out to be a true prediction.
</p><p>“All our trouble and forethought thrown away,” said Suzanne sulkily, when they had pushed their way fruitlessly through half a dozen departments.
</p><p>“I can’t think why you didn’t grab him by the arm,” said Eleanor; “I would have if I’d known him longer, but I’d only just been introduced.&nbsp; It’s nearly four now, we’d better have tea.”
</p><p>Some days later Suzanne rang Eleanor up on the telephone.
</p><p>“Thank you very much for the photograph frame.&nbsp; It was just what I wanted.&nbsp; Very good of you.&nbsp; I say, do you know what that Kneyght person has given me?&nbsp; Just what you said he would – a wretched fan.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Oh yes, quite a good enough fan in its way, but still . . .”
</p><p>“You must come and see what he’s given me,” came in Eleanor’s voice over the ’phone.
</p><p>“You!&nbsp; Why should he give you anything?”
</p><p>“Your cousin appears to be one of those rare people of wealth who take a pleasure in giving good presents,” came the reply.
</p><p>“I wondered why he was so anxious to know where she lived,” snapped Suzanne to herself as she rang off.
</p><p>A cloud has arisen between the friendships of the two young women; as far as Eleanor is concerned the cloud has a silver-fox lining.
