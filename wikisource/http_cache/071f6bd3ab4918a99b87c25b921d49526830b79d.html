<p>It was autumn in London, that blessed season between the harshness of winter and the insincerities of summer; a trustful season when one buys bulbs and sees to the registration of one’s vote, believing perpetually in spring and a change of Government.
</p><p>Morton Crosby sat on a bench in a secluded corner of Hyde Park, lazily enjoying a cigarette and watching the slow grazing promenade of a pair of snow-geese, the male looking rather like an albino edition of the russet-hued female.  Out of the corner of his eye Crosby also noted with some interest the hesitating hoverings of a human figure, which had passed and repassed his seat two or three times at shortening intervals, like a wary crow about to alight near some possibly edible morsel.  Inevitably the figure came to an anchorage on the bench, within easy talking distance of its original occupant.  The uncared-for clothes, the aggressive, grizzled beard, and the furtive, evasive eye of the new-comer bespoke the professional cadger, the man who would undergo hours of humiliating tale-spinning and rebuff rather than adventure on half a day’s decent work.
</p><p>For a while the new-comer fixed his eyes straight in front of him in a strenuous, unseeing gaze; then his voice broke out with the insinuating inflection of one who has a story to retail well worth any loiterer’s while to listen to.
</p><p>“It’s a strange world,” he said.
</p><p>As the statement met with no response he altered it to the form of a question.
</p><p>“I daresay you’ve found it to be a strange world, mister?”
</p><p>“As far as I am concerned,” said Crosby, “the strangeness has worn off in the course of thirty-six years.”
</p><p>“Ah,” said the greybeard, “I could tell you things that you’d hardly believe.  Marvellous things that have really happened to me.”
</p><p>“Nowadays there is no demand for marvellous things that have really happened,” said Crosby discouragingly; “the professional writers of fiction turn these things out so much better.  For instance, my neighbours tell me wonderful, incredible things that their Aberdeens and chows and borzois have done; I never listen to them.  On the other hand, I have read ‘The Hound of the Baskervilles’ three times.”
</p><p>The greybeard moved uneasily in his seat; then he opened up new country.
</p><p>“I take it that you are a professing Christian,” he observed.
</p><p>“I am a prominent and I think I may say an influential member of the Mussulman community of Eastern Persia,” said Crosby, making an excursion himself into the realms of fiction.
</p><p>The greybeard was obviously disconcerted at this new check to introductory conversation, but the defeat was only momentary.
</p><p>“Persia.  I should never have taken you for a Persian,” he remarked, with a somewhat aggrieved air.
</p><p>“I am not,” said Crosby; “my father was an Afghan.”
</p><p>“An Afghan!” said the other, smitten into bewildered silence for a moment.  Then he recovered himself and renewed his attack.
</p><p>“Afghanistan.  Ah!  We’ve had some wars with that country; now, I daresay, instead of fighting it we might have learned something from it.  A very wealthy country, I believe.  No real poverty there.”
</p><p>He raised his voice on the word “poverty” with a suggestion of intense feeling.  Crosby saw the opening and avoided it.
</p><p>“It possesses, nevertheless, a number of highly talented and ingenious beggars,” he said; “if I had not spoken so disparagingly of marvellous things that have really happened I would tell you the story of Ibrahim and the eleven camel-loads of blotting-paper.  Also I have forgotten exactly how it ended.”
</p><p>“My own life-story is a curious one,” said the stranger, apparently stifling all desire to hear the history of Ibrahim; “I was not always as you see me now.”
</p><p>“We are supposed to undergo complete change in the course of every seven years,” said Crosby, as an explanation of the foregoing announcement.
</p><p>“I mean I was not always in such distressing circumstances as I am at present,” pursued the stranger doggedly.
</p><p>“That sounds rather rude,” said Crosby stiffly, “considering that you are at present talking to a man reputed to be one of the most gifted conversationalists of the Afghan border.”
</p><p>“I don’t mean in that way,” said the greybeard hastily; “I’ve been very much interested in your conversation.  I was alluding to my unfortunate financial situation.  You mayn’t hardly believe it, but at the present moment I am absolutely without a farthing.  Don’t see any prospect of getting any money, either, for the next few days.  I don’t suppose you’ve ever found yourself in such a position,” he added.
</p><p>“In the town of Yom,” said Crosby, “which is in Southern Afghanistan, and which also happens to be my birthplace, there was a Chinese philosopher who used to say that one of the three chiefest human blessings was to be absolutely without money.  I forget what the other two were.”
</p><p>“Ah, I daresay,” said the stranger, in a tone that betrayed no enthusiasm for the philosopher’s memory; “and did he practise what he preached?  That’s the test.”
</p><p>“He lived happily with very little money or resources,” said Crosby.
</p><p>“Then I expect he had friends who would help him liberally whenever he was in difficulties, such as I am in at present.”
</p><p>“In Yom,” said Crosby, “it is not necessary to have friends in order to obtain help.  Any citizen of Yom would help a stranger as a matter of course.”
</p><p>The greybeard was now genuinely interested. The conversation had at last taken a favourable turn.
</p><p>“If someone, like me, for instance, who was in undeserved difficulties, asked a citizen of that town you speak of for a small loan to tide over a few days’ impecuniosity – five shillings, or perhaps a rather larger sum – would it be given to him as a matter of course?”
</p><p>“There would be a certain preliminary,” said Crosby; “one would take him to a wine-shop and treat him to a measure of wine, and then, after a little high-flown conversation, one would put the desired sum in his hand and wish him good-day.  It is a roundabout way of performing a simple transaction, but in the East all ways are roundabout.”
</p><p>The listener’s eyes were glittering.
</p><p>“Ah,” he exclaimed, with a thin sneer ringing meaningly through his words, “I suppose you’ve given up all those generous customs since you left your town.  Don’t practise them now, I expect.”
</p><p>“No one who has lived in Yom,” said Crosby fervently, “and remembers its green hills covered with apricot and almond trees, and the cold water that rushes down like a caress from the upland snows and dashes under the little wooden bridges, no one who remembers these things and treasures the memory of them would ever give up a single one of its unwritten laws and customs.  To me they are as binding as though I still lived in that hallowed home of my youth.”
</p><p>“Then if I was to ask you for a small loan – ” began the greybeard fawningly, edging nearer on the seat and hurriedly wondering how large he might safely make his request, “if I was to ask you for, say – ”
</p><p>“At any other time, certainly,” said Crosby; “in the months of November and December, however, it is absolutely forbidden for anyone of our race to give or receive loans or gifts; in fact, one does not willingly speak of them.  It is considered unlucky.  We will therefore close this discussion.”
</p><p>“But it is still October!” exclaimed the adventurer with an eager, angry whine, as Crosby rose from his seat; “wants eight days to the end of the month!”
</p><p>“The Afghan November began yesterday,” said Crosby severely, and in another moment he was striding across the Park, leaving his recent companion scowling and muttering furiously on the seat.
</p><p>“I don’t believe a word of his story,” he chattered to himself; “pack of nasty lies from beginning to end.  Wish I’d told him so to his face.  Calling himself an Afghan!”
</p><p>The snorts and snarls that escaped from him for the next quarter of an hour went far to support the truth of the old saying that two of a trade never agree.
